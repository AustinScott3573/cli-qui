This was my first quiz at Nashville Software School. It was an exercise in the use of Cascading Style Sheets to target and style
certain parts of the poems following these instructions -

/* 1. Open the quiz.css file in Sublime text.
  2. Change the font for the entire document to Arial.
  3. Change the font for the sonnet sections to Tahoma.
  4. Pick your favorite line from each sonnet and highlight it with the color of your choice.
  5. The main body should take up 65% width.
  6. The right sidebar should take up 30% width.
  7. Commit the file to git and push it to Github. */
  
  This is my second use of Github and most likely the third or fourth day of class. All code remains unchanged to show progress
  from the first day to present day repositories.
  
  To display; just clone the repository and run on your local machine(http-server)
